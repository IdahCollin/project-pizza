# Project: Javascript Pizzeria

Week 1 of Technigo boot camp. A basic set-up of the web page was given from Technigo. The project was to develop the basic JavaScript part of the web page. Variables, conditionals and native methods.

## The problem

As a beginner I started out by reading the material, get a overview of the assignment and then work through it from top to bottom. Giving myself a structure helped. ChatGPT, Google, Stack Overflow and Slack was used. 

What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?
