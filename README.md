# Project: Javascript Pizzeria

Week 1 of Technigo boot camp. A basic set-up of the web page was given from Technigo. The project was to develop the basic JavaScript part of the web page.

## The problem

I started out by reading the material, get a overview of the assignment and then work through it from top to bottom. Giving myself a structure helped. ChatGPT, Google, Stack Overflow and Slack was used. 

The challenge was to grasp the JavaScript. Next step would be to change parts of the code to "switch" and clean up my code.
