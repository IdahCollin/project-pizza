# Project: Javascript Pizzeria

Week 1 of Technigo bootcamp. A basic set-up of the web page was given. The project was to develop the basic JavaScript part of the web page.

## The problem

I started out by reading the material, get a overview of the assignment and then work through it from top to bottom. Giving myself a structure helped. ChatGPT, Google, Stack Overflow and Slack was used. 

The challenge was to grasp the JavaScript.

VScode was used. Alert () method, else-if, switch, ternary operators was added to the javaScript.

With more time, more switch and a more cleaned code would have been added.

Two javaScript files are included. I started out with the script.js to save the first code. The swith.js is connected with the html.
